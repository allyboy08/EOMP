    <p>By the early 1950s, surfing can be traced as the source of skateboarding.
       Some surfers had the idea to transfer the feeling of riding waves onto the streets to defy times of days with a gentle swell.
       Not without any reason these dudes were called “asphalt surfers”.
       At two spots in the world a kind of a skateboard was developed at the first time in the early 1950s: California and Hawaii.
       They used shorter surfboards and wheels made out of metal without some bearings.
       In the late 1950s, skateboarding had a first peak. 
       During the post-war period, the U.S. economy boomed and this also affected the toy industry. 
       During that time, the toy industry became aware of the board with wheels. In 1959, 
       Roller Derby released the first official skateboard with some new technical developments. 
       Thereby, the handling characteristics have been improved.
       For this reason, skateboarders were able to develop new tricks and maneuvers.
